# MSSQL_SERVER
### Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet).

### Stored Procedures

#### SQL Server stored procedure is a batch of statements grouped as a logical unit and stored in the database. The stored procedure accepts the parameters and executes the T-SQL statements in the procedure, returns the result set if any. Stored procedures can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.
